 Image binary classifier that distinguishes between real and fake human face images 
    
∙ Deep Learning project 
∙ Objective: To build a deep learning model that can detect whether a human face image is real or fake 
                    — specifically distinguishing real photographs from AI-generated or photoshopped images.
∙ Models Used: ResNet50, Inception v3 (GoogLeNet), VGG16
